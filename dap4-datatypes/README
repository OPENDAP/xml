This directory contains a relaxNG datatype library that will enable a
XML editor that supports validation to recognize the type names
specific to DAP4 (e.g., dap4_int) used in the dap4.rng grammar.

To build, use 'ant jar'.

To install the library, configure your editor to use the library
build/dap4-datatypes.jar. 

Here's how to do that for the OxygenXML plugin running with Eclipse:

First we need to find the OxygenXML directory for plugins/libraries. When
it is running under Eclipse, this will be a directory named something like
'com.oxygenxml.editor_14.0.0...' inside the Eclipse 'plugins' directory. On
My system it is:
/Applications/eclipse-3.7/plugins/com.oxygenxml.editor_14.0.0.v2012071212

Call that directory $oxy.

To install and configure the library, copy build/dap4-datatypes.jar to 
$oxy/lib and then edit $oxy/plugin.xml so that it contains the line
'<library name="lib/dap4-datatypes.jar"/>' within the <runtime> element.

Restart Eclipse.

The standalone OxygenXML editor should configure in more or less the same
way, modulo the Eclipse part of the pathname.

Note that whenever Eclipse updates OxygenXML, even for the same version of
the editor but with a different build date, the lib will have to be
reinstalled. For example, I have to 14.0.0 directories with different build
dates. The lib needs to be installed in the copy of oxygen that actually
used.
